I started on the website, section by section. I did the basic layout and styling, coming to the better effects in the end. I analysed the Figma file for the colours, structure and positioning and tried recreating them as such in the website. For the layout, I've mostly used Flexbox and CSS positioning, and a little bit of Grid.
